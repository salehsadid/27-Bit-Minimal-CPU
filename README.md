27-Bit Minimal Computer :
This project involves the design and implementation of a 27-bit minimal computer using Logisim. It features a control unit managing a 11-instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle, an ALU supporting arithmetic and logical operations, and a 6-bit address space limiting memory to 64 locations. The system ensures synchronized execution through a master clock, coordinating the ALU, registers, and memory. Logisimâ€™s built-in RAM facilitates instruction storage and execution. This project explores fundamental CPU design concepts, control logic, and memory management using digital logic simulation.
